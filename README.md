# spz

`.spz` is a file format for compressed 3D gaussian splats. This directory contains a C++ library
for saving and loading data in the .spz format.

spz encoded splats are typically around 10x smaller than the corresponding .ply files,
with minimal visual differences between the two.

## Command-Line Tool

This repository includes `spz-convert`, a handy command-line tool for converting .ply or .splat files to the compressed .spz format.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Build the project
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Convert a PLY file to SPZ
./spz-convert input.ply output.spz

# Convert a .splat file to SPZ  
./spz-convert input.splat output.spz

# Show help
./spz-convert --help
```

### Features

- **PLY Support**: Convert standard PLY files containing Gaussian splat data
- **SPLAT Support**: Convert binary .splat files (32-byte records)
- **Coordinate System Conversion**: Automatic conversion between different coordinate systems
- **Compression**: Achieve ~10x compression ratio compared to PLY files
- **Spherical Harmonics**: Preserve spherical harmonics data up to degree 3
- **Antialiasing**: Support for mip-splatting antialiasing flag

See [tools/README.md](tools/README.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## Internals

### Coordinate System

SPZ stores data internally in an RUB coordinate system following the OpenGL and three.js
convention. This differs from other data formats such as PLY (which typically uses RDF), GLB (which
typically uses LUF), or Unity (which typically uses RUF). To aid with coordinate system conversions,
callers should specify the coordinate system their Gaussian Cloud data is represented in when saving
and what coordinate system their rendering system uses when loading. These are specified in the
PackOptions and UnpackOptions respectively.  If the coordinate system is `UNSPECIFIED`, data will
be saved and loaded without conversion, which may harm interoperability.

## Implementations

### C++

Requires `libz` as the only dependent library, otherwise the code is completely self-contained.
A CMake build system is provided for convenience.

## API

```
bool saveSpz(
   const GaussianCloud &gaussians, PackOptions &options, std::vector<uint8_t> *output);
```

Converts a cloud of Gaussians in `.spz` format to a vector of bytes.

   - `gaussians`: The Gaussians to save
   - `options`: Flags that control the packing behavior.
   - `output`: A vector that will be populated with bytes encoded in .spz format
   - Returns true on success and false on failure.

---

```
bool saveSpz(
   const GaussianCloud &gaussians, const PackOptions &options, const std::string
&filename);
```

Saves a cloud of Gaussians in `.spz` format to a file

   - `gaussians`: The Gaussians to save
   - `options`: Flags that control the packing behavior.
   - `filename`: The path to the file to save to.
   - Returns true on success and false on failure.

---

```
GaussianCloud loadSpz(const std::vector<uint8_t> &data, const UnpackOptions &opti
ons);
```

Loads a cloud of Gaussians from bytes in `.spz` format.

   - `data`: A vector containing the encoded spz data
   - `options`: Flags that control the unpacking behavior.
   - Returns a `GaussianCloud` decoded from the vector. In case of an error, this will return
     a result with no gaussians

---

```
GaussianCloud loadSpz(const std::string &filename, const UnpackOptions &options);
```

Loads a cloud of Gaussians from a file in `.spz` format.

   - `filename`: The path to the file to load from.
   - `options`: Flags that control the unpacking behavior.
   - Returns a `GaussianCloud` decoded from the file. In case of an error, this will return
     a result with no gaussians

## File Format

The .spz format is a gzipped stream of data consisting of a 16-byte header followed by the
gaussian data. This data is organized by attribute in the following order: positions,
alphas, colors, scales, rotations, spherical harmonics.

### Header

```c
struct PackedGaussiansHeader {
  uint32_t magic;
  uint32_t version;
  uint32_t numPoints;
  uint8_t shDegree;
  uint8_t fractionalBits;
  uint8_t flags;
  uint8_t reserved;
};
```

All values are little-endian.

1. **magic**: This is always 0x5053474e
2. **version**: Currently, the only valid version is 2
3. **numPoints**: The number of gaussians
4. **shDegree**: The degree of spherical harmonics. This must be between 0 and 3 (inclusive).
5. **fractionalBits**: The number of bits used to store the fractional part of coordinates in
   the fixed-point encoding.
6. **flags**: A bit field containing flags.
   - `0x1`: whether the splat was trained with [antialiasing](https://niujinshuchong.github.io/mip-splatting/).
7. **reserved**: Reserved for future use. Must be 0.

### Positions

Positions are represented as `(x, y, z)` coordinates, each as a 24-bit fixed point signed integer.
The number of fractional bits is determined by the `fractionalBits` field in the header.

### Scales

Scales are represented as `(x, y, z)` components, each represented as an 8-bit log-encoded integer.

### Rotation

Rotations are represented as the `(x, y, z)` components of the normalized rotation quaternion. The
`w` component can be derived from the others and is not stored. Each components is encoded as an
8-bit signed integer.

### Alphas

Alphas are represented as 8-bit unsigned integers.

### Colors

Colors are stored as `(r, g, b)` values, where each color component is represented as an
unsigned 8-bit integer.

### Spherical Harmonics

Depending on the degree of spherical harmonics for the splat, this can contain 0 (for degree 0),
9 (for degree 1), 24 (for degree 2), or 45 (for degree 3) coefficients per gaussian.

The coefficients for a gaussian are organized such that the color channel is the inner (faster
varying) axis, and the coefficient is the outer (slower varying) axis, i.e. for degree 1,
the order of the 9 values is:

```
sh1n1_r, sh1n1_g, sh1n1_b, sh10_r, sh10_g, sh10_b, sh1p1_r, sh1p1_g, sh1p1_b
```

Each coefficient is represented as an 8-bit signed integer. Additional quantization can be performed
to attain a higher compression ratio. This library currently uses 5 bits of precision for degree 0
and 4 bits of precision for degrees 1 and 2, but this may be changed in the future without breaking
backwards compatibility.
